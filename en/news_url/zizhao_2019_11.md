Tsinghua University Supervisor: [Yue Gao](http://gaoyue.org/cn_tsinghua/people/gaoyue_index.html) **Research interests:** Brain Science, Graph Signal Processing, Complex Network **Long-term research goal:** In recent years, many brain disorders have been found to be associated with topological structure abnormalities of large-scale functional networks, such as Alzheimer’s (AD), Parkinson’s (PD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ). However, human brain is a complex network and the brain functional activity is a real-time dynamic process. How to bridge the gap between the brain networks and the brain disorders is an important task. The long-term goal of my research is to establish the automated diagnosis and pathological mechanisms understanding of brain disorders using brain functional and structural network.
