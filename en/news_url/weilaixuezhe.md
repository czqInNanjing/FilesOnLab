#Yutong Feng was selected as a "Future Scholar" of Tsinghua University
The project of the laboratory Yutong Feng was responsible for the diagnosis of dyskinesia disease based on motion recognition technology. It was selected as the first batch of Tsinghua University's 2019 "Future Scholars" program, and the first batch of the whole school was **only 4 projects selected**. The "Future Scholars" program is to stimulate students' academic interest, encourage students to carry out independent research, highlight key areas, promote interdisciplinary and encourage original innovation. In 2014, the Youth League Committee and Research Institute jointly launched the Tsinghua University Student Academic Research Promotion Plan. (The original "Tsinghua University Undergraduate Academic Research Fund"), matching project funding and other resources support, open applications for individual students or teams throughout the school, and strive to cultivate academic innovative talents through solid academic research projects. Since 2016, the Tsinghua University Academic Research Promotion Program has established a "Future Scholar" support program to support individual or team projects with strong research and innovation capabilities, innovative projects, and long-term academic research careers. The reference amount for matching the implementation funds for each project is 200,000 yuan per year, which can be added according to actual needs.

##Project Description:
Parkinson's disease is a kind of middle-aged and elderly nervous system degenerative diseases with high prevalence and serious harm. The main clinical manifestations are behavioral disorders such as gait disorder and involuntary tremor. The pathogenesis is unknown and there is no fundamental cure. At this stage, the subjective descriptive index is used to evaluate the severity of Parkinson's disease. It is obtained by the relevant doctors through visual observation. The assessment of the condition is not objective and accurate, which makes it impossible for doctors to accurately grasp the patient's condition. At the same time, it lacks tools that can automate the assessment of the disease and is difficult to obtain. The patient's condition changes slightly over a long period of time. This project is aimed at the behavioral disorder of Parkinson's disease. Based on the objective quantitative quantitative criteria for different behavioral obstacles, the corresponding quantitative methods and techniques are developed to realize the automated and intelligent behavior signal quantification. At the same time, the basis of the behavioral quantified signal is obtained. In addition, further explore its coupling relationship with the patient's bioelectrical signals, thus providing new ideas for related pathological research and treatment.
